    </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center">
        My name is Parth Matta. I did my schooling from Goodley Public School. I have many interests and hobbies, 
        some of which are playing football, listening to songs, Discussing movies and series online. I am now trying some new thngs to pass my time like leaning how to animate in 2-D and 
        learning how to use blender and how to code in Unity.
        I am a novice programmer. I am learning new things about programming every day in college and in the clubs
        i joined. I am still trying to decide in which field of the IT sector should i go to.
